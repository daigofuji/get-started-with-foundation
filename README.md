Zurb Foundation 6, what is updated and how to get started

Description: Zurb released a new version of Foundation for Sites, a CSS and Front-End Framework last month. Daigo will walk through the features and also show how you can get up and running with a new site using this framework in just few minutes. Great for getting something up really quick, like in a hackathon. We can discuss pros and cons of css and front end frameworks in general as well.
