## [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/)

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through our site.

You can create and publish GitHub Pages online using the Automatic Page Generator. If you prefer to work locally, you can use the GitHub Desktop or the command line.

## [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

.small[From http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/]

Github's doc on [how to use Jekyll on Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) is also helpful.
